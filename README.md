⚪ **MAGI System is an Evangelion-inspired utility Discord bot.**

---

🔴 I initially created this bot to study Discord automations by practical means. I am not a professional software engineer, product designer, programmers, et cetera. In this repository, you may find unconventional codewriting style, or a straight up mess of code/logic. 

🖤 I do, however, love the practice of design.

## 💠 Tokens

Most of the functions of MAGI System is dependant on other services such as the Discord bot application, and Alchemy for blockchain-related functions.  

> 🔑 Obtain your Discord bot token once it's set up on Developer Portal.  
> 🔑 Grab the Application ID of your Discord bot as well on Developer Portal.  
> 🔑 Alchemy API key can be obtained with a free account on [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).

💾 Create a `.env` file on the root directory of this app in your machine.  

```js
ALCHEMY_TOKEN = '<YOUR-KEY-GOES-HERE>'
DISCORD_TOKEN = '<YOUR-KEY-GOES-HERE>'
CLIENT_ID = '<YOUR-KEY-GOES-HERE>'
```

🔻 *Be sure to never share or accidentally upload your personal tokens!*

## ⏹ Bot Design
---

MAGI System is designed with modular functions in mind, following the [discord.js Guide](https://discordjs.guide/#before) while applying necessary changes. In a nutshell, the bot consists of three main parts: 
- [💬 Commands](null)
- [📰 Contents](null)
- [📢 Events](null)  

This is done to keep the development environment tidy, and ensure that future maintenance will be as easy as possible.
