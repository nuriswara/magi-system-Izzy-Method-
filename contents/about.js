const AboutMagi = `The Supercomputer Magi System (マギ) are a trio of supercomputers designed by Dr. Naoko Akagi during her research into bio-computers while at Gehirn. The Magi's 7th generation organic computers were implanted with three differing aspects of Dr. Naoko Akagi's personality using the Personality Transplant OS (Operating System), being her persona as a woman (Casper-Magi 3), her persona as a mother (Balthasar-Magi 2), and her persona as a scientist (Melchior-Magi 1). The same system is used to operate the **Evangelions**.`;
